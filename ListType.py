List is a collection of items,
List are very powerful in Python , because they let you store multiple pices of data in one place
you create list by placing items inside square bracker [], separated by commas
ex:[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
list can also hold the string and mix of different datatypes
"""
"""
List Features:
1. you can add item to list,remove items or sort the list in different ways.
2. you can access the indvidual items by their position [called an index].
3. in python list are zero indexed, which mean first item is at the zero position and second at the 1 position and so on.
ex if you have a list called number and you want to get the first item, you would write
number[0]
"""
number=[1,2,3,4,5]
print(number[0])
"""
4. Python allow you to slice list. which means you can take the portion of a list.
    you can get the first 3 numbers from the number list by writing numbe[0:3]
"""
print(number[0:3])
